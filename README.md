Simplified MIPS in Verilog
================

Implementation of a simplified version of the MIPS Pipeline in Verilog hardware description language.

The pipeline implemented in this repository has 5 stages.

1. Instruction fetch
2. Decode
3. Execution
4. Memory Access
5. WriteBack


## Running
You will need [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) to run our code. It is a 
Verilog simulation and synthesis tool.
