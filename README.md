UFMG-OC2-Verilog
================

Implementation of a simplified version of the MIPS Pipelined in Verilog hardware description language.

Its pipeline has 5 stages.

1. Fetch of instruction
2. Decode.
3. Execution
4. Memory Access
5. WriteBack


After the simulation on the softwares Icarus Verilog in ModelSim, this project was transferred to an Altera FPGA (MODEL: DE2);
